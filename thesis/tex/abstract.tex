As part of the Human Brain Project, BrainScaleS System is a unique project on many levels.
This includes a processor solely used by the HICANN-DLS, which manages synaptic weights for every neuron built into one of the many wafers through a special I/O bus. 
To accelerate the speed at which this so called plasticity processor unit or ``nux'' computes all synaptic weights of every neuron used, the processor has an extended instruction set architecture that supports vector registers and single input multiple data.

This report deals with the task of adding built-in functions to an existing back-end of GCC, specifically the one already used by nux, in order to extend the already implemented set of functions according to the user's needs.
