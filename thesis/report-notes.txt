4-5 bulletpoints that decribe the current state of compiler support

- establishing support of the vector extension of nux in GCC
- support for C-style vector parallelization with common vector type and intrinsic functions
- asm inline coding supports automatic variable handling
- optimization is enabled for vector code
- overall more user-friendly and easy to use state than before
- appendix add -mdebug
